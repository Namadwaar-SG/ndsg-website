                <strong>Kadhai Kelu Kadhai Kelu</strong> is a series of discourse by Brahmasri Ravi Teja ji on portions of Srimad Bhagavatam. 
                <i> "Kadhai"</i> in Tamil translates to <i>story</i>, and <i>"Kelu"</i> translates to <i>listen</i>. This series encompasses the beauty of listening  to
                the stories of Bhagavan and immersing yourself in his thoughts.

                Sri Swamiji says, the <span className='underlined decoration-solid'>easiest way to attain bhakti and subsequently liberation</span> is by listening to these stories. Earnest listening to stories of bhagavan is hailed as most profound. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Great sadhus and saints of pure Sattva quality (devoid of jealousy, ego and anger) yearn to listen to such stories, for it purifies the heart. King Parikshit is celebrated for his utmost focus, reverence and dedication with which he listened and savored the divine Srimad Bhagavatam. <span className='underlined decoration-solid'>Through this alone he was able to attain the Lord</span>, showing the significance of simply listening.

                Hearing stories merely enhances our intellect, but truly listening to Srimad Bhagavatham and allowing it to touch our hearts is called <span className='underlined decoration-wavy font-bold'>Shravanam.</span> This is truly an egoless state. A state that facilitates inner transformation, one that leads us to the almighty.
